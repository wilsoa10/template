                        <p>This video is incredibly moving. When I begun to watch, I know this wasnt simply another youtube video. This one had purpose to it. The sprawling cursive upon the chalkboard drew me into to its purpose and allowed me to capture its message. Hope. When the grand son arrived on the screen I was already entrawled in the emotion portrayed. He begins with a simply beautiful poem that speaks to the enigma that is greatness. What is it? How is it defined? Is there not greatness in all of us? I believe the purpose of the video is to portray to us the meaning of that poem; that greatness is defined by each indivudual. 
                        
                      The video attempts to achieve its purpose by playing to the watchers humanity. It does not include politics or policy, it simply speaks to the human in all of us. Death is something is around all of us, and the story of the suicide of his uncle endears us to the speaker. For me and several thousand other youtube viewers I believe he succeded in making his point.
